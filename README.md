# Hello

Please find my attempt at assignment 1, everything is commented in the code, all you need is to change run parameters to test single or multi scale. 

As for Extra credit, please make sure the extra credit functions are commented out in order to get the clean output. 

when testing Automatic Contrasting, please uncomment:

im_out = sine_contrast(im_out)


when testing Better Color Mapping, please uncomment:

    im_out = color_correction(im_out)

    im_out = gamma_correction(im_out, gamma=1.2)

And comment out:
im_out = sine_contrast(im_out)


Enjoy!
