# Wonder360

This project extends WonderWorld by addressing its limitation of only generating frontal-facing surfaces.  
We extract foreground objects, generate novel views using ImageDream, and reconstruct complete 3D geometry with a large multi-view Gaussian model (LGM).  
Our method enables high-fidelity 360Â° scene exploration from a single input image.

All project details, methodology, experiments, and results are available on the [project website](./path-to-website/index.html).
